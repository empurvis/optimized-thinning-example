# optimized-thinning-example

This is a pared down example of the mathematical optimization techniques used in the FOCAL lab Yuba large trees project. The Rmd file contains an introduction to mathematical optimization and walks through the creation and solution of an example problem where optimization is used to thin plots to match both a density and basal area distribution. The PDF file is an appendix to the Rmd file and contains supplementary tables and mathematical notation related to the decision variables, constraints, and objective function.
